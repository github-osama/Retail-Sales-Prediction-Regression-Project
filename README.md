Rossmann operates an extensive network of drug stores spanning across 7 European countries, totaling more than 3,000 locations. The current responsibility assigned to Rossmann store managers entails predicting the daily sales for a period of up to six weeks in advance. The sales of these stores are influenced by a multitude of factors, which include promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and the specific locality in which each store is situated. Due to the unique circumstances faced by individual managers, who number in the thousands, the accuracy of their sales predictions can exhibit considerable variation.

As part of this task, we have been granted access to historical sales data pertaining to 1,115 Rossmann stores. Your objective is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. It is important to note that certain stores within the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.
